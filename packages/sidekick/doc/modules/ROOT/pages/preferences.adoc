== Command preferences

[#command-repetition]
=== Command repetition

Repeat every command::
Enable to send every command several times in a row

Repeat count::
This value defines how many times each command is sent

Delay between attempts::
This value defines the delay between the repetitions

=== Confirmations

In this section you can customize confirmations when sending commands to individual drones or broadcasting them to all drones.

Enabled confirmations raise the safety of GCS usage by potentially preventing an accidental execution of a command, but at the same time they also increase the reaction time of the control personnel in situations to be handled from the GCS.

== Server preferences

image::preferences_server.jpg[server settings]

*Skybrush Sidekick* can receive telemetry data from the drones through *Skybrush Server*. The settings in this panel (hostname and port) control where *Skybrush Sidekick* is looking for the server on the net to communicate with.

The LED indicator in the bottom left corner shows the status of the connection to *Skybrush Server*.

To connect to *Skybrush Server* with the given settings, press the kbd:[CONNECT] button.

To save the desired configuration, press the kbd:[SAVE] button.
