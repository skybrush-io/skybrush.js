= Connection widgets
:imagesdir: ../../assets/images
:experimental:

There are three connection widgets on the top left corner of the main window. Each of them has a LED indicator to show their overall status with the following color codes:

[%autowidth]
|===
|[red]*red*|error
|[yellow]*yellow*|warning
|[green]*green*|status OK
|===

TIP: For a more detailed connection status move your cursor over the connection widgets and wait for the tooltips to appear.

== Output device connection

The only strictly required hardware component for *Skybrush Sidekick* is a radio module connected to the computer running *Skybrush Sidekick*. Please check our the xref:hardware.adoc[Hardware requirements] section for the list of supported radio modules.

If you click on the output device connection widget, a popup dialog appears to setup the connection.

It is assumed that the output device is connected though a serial or USB-serial port with a given port name and baud rate. Set these up properly and press the kbd:[CONNECT] button to connect to the device. The green status LED on the bottom left corner indicates connection status.

=== Skybrush Server connection

Connection to *Skybrush Server* is optional but it is recommended, as it feeds useful status information from the drones to *Skybrush Sidekick*. It is also needed if you wish to send RTK correction data through *Skybrush Sidekick* as well.

The connection details can be setup in the SERVER page of the xref:preferences.adoc[Preferences] dialog. *Skybrush Server* typically listens on port 5002 for incoming *Sidekick* connections. The IP address of the machine running *Skybrush Server* has to be specified explicitly. If the server and *Sidekick* are running on the same machine, the IP address can be set to 127.0.0.1 (localhost).

=== RTK connection

if *Skybrush Server* is connected and *Skybrush Live* is configured to send RTK correction data to the drones on the primary wi-fi connection, these corrections can also be forwarded to *Skybrush Sidekick* to send them to the drones simultaneously on its secondary communication channel as a means of redundancy.

No explicit configuration is needed in *Skybrush Sidekick* to enable RTK corrections, and enabling them will not interfere with the same corrections sent over the primary channel, but the probability that the corrections with reach the drones will increase.
