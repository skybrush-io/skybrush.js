This is the main documentation of *Skybrush Sidekick*, a companion app to be used along with *Skybrush Live* as an independent fallback control interface for safe drone fleet operations.

Before you fly with *Skybrush Sidekick*, make sure you have read the entire documentation carefully. Use the left sidebar for browsing and we also encourage you to mailto:support@collmot.com[contact us] in case of any questions.

Remember, drone swarms are great fun but only if you know how to handle them!
